# Satellite-Command-System
Satellite Command System Programming Exercise as a part of Coding Exercise Round.
The system is programmed in Java (using JDK 21).

There are two java classes and a log file in this repo.

The SatelliteControl class (with main function) defines the logic behind working of the Satellite Command System and it contains the **main function** as well so the execution begins from there.

The Satellite class defines the attributes of the Satellite and the functions associated with it as mentioned in the problem statement. 

The log file is generated for logging all types of info, warnings and errors encountered during the execution of the system.
The log file uploaded serves as an example to the same. If the file is not available, it can be generated automatically during the execution of the program.

The system implements the required concepts and is developed following best practices, SOLID principles, and intuitive logic.
